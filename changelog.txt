Tue Sep 13 15:57:28 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se)

	* Version 3.2-5 released.

	* descrip.mms, build.com: added `*.hlp' to DISTFILES.
	(all): adds "/L_DOUBLE=64" to all_cflags if on AXP, to make
	sure it can be linked with the library for AXP DEC C version 1.3.
	(versions): renamed from zip.version.
	(dist_tar): depends on versions.

	* vms2tar.c (out_file): attempted to write code to recognise
	text files when they are variable length record files with
	no record attributes.  So far, I failed.  Added this as a
	short term wish in aaatodo.txt.

Mon Sep 12 08:18:29 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@elmer.e.kth.se)

	* vmstar_cmdline.c (get_list): len will be set to 0 if *str
	is NULL.

	* descrip.mms: extension of object files will have "VAXC_" in
	it if compiled with VAX C.  Now also distribute object files
	in the zip archive.

	* build.com, link.com: Changed accordingly.

	* version.opt: version changed to 3.2-5.

Wed Sep  7 17:33:43 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@elton.e.kth.se)

	* descrip.mms (all): changed so it will recognise "/VAXC" in
	the macro CFLAGS, and act properly in that case.

Wed Sep  7 15:00:00 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@elton.e.kth.se)

	* Version 3.2-4 released.

Wed Sep  7 14:42:52 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@elton.e.kth.se)

	* vmstar_cmdline.c (vmstar_cmdline): found_options now
	initialised to 0.

	* descrip.vax_mms, descrip.alpha_mms: removed.

	* descrip.mms: now checks if DEC C exists, and chooses it
	over VAX C if it does.  Now invokes descrip.common_mms
	directly.  Two distribution clauses added.

	* vmstar.rnh: a few spelling errors corrected, and a
	Stellan Lagerström added to the "Thanks" list.

	* aaatodo.txt: renamed from todo.txt.

	* version.opt: version changed to 3.2-4.

Mon Sep  5 09:20:00 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@elmer.e.kth.se)

	* Version 3.2-3 released.

Mon Sep  5 09:19:11 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@elmer.e.kth.se)

	* vmstar.h: removed `/' from BADCHARS.

	* version.opt: version changed to 3.2-3.

Fri Sep  2 12:27:05 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se)

	* Version 3.2-2 released.

Fri Sep  2 11:18:44 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se)

	* vmstar.c (main): Changed so there will be an error message
	if no input files are specified with the /CREATE option.

	* version.opt: version changed to 3.2-2.

Thu Sep  1 22:05:45 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se)

	* vmsmunch.c (VMSmunch): On VAX, atr$l_addr is unsigned long.
	On AXP, it is void *.  I fixed a workaround.  Also, for
	SET_TIMES, only change the times that are really given.

	* vmstar_cmdline.c (vmstar_cmdline): Added processing of
	/DATE_POLICY

	* vmstar_cld.cld: Added the /DATE_POLICY qualifier.

	* tar2vms.c (copyfile): Set actime and modtime depending
	on the date policy

	* version.opt: version changed to 3.2-1.

Thu Sep  1 11:43:57 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@elmer.e.kth.se)

	* vmstar.rnh: added help about the /DATE_POLICY qualifier.

	* vms2tar.c, tar2vms.c: added dependency on vmstar_cmdline.h.

	* vmstar_cmdline.c: got the Unix option parsing code that was
	previously in vmstar.c.  Changed the VMS option parsing code
	to set the option variables directly instead of converting them
	to Unix options.  Changed so vmstar_clitables will only be
	globalref with VAX C.

	* vmstar_cmdline.h: got the option variables that were previously
	in vmstarP.h.

	* descrip.common_mms: Changed to reflect changes in dependency.

	* version.opt: version changed to 3.2.

Wed Aug 24 12:05:18 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@elmer.e.kth.se)

	* data.c, tar2vms.c, vms2tar.c, vmsmunch.c, vmstar.c,
	vmstar_cmdline.c: changed so the module name will be set
	right with DEC C on VAX also.

	* version.opt: version changed to 3.1-3.

Sat Aug 20 04:44:07 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se)

	* vmstar.h (BADCHARS, TRANSLATE):  added a few more forbidden
	characters in BADCHARS, and made their translation an underscore.

Sat Jul 23 17:02:40 1994  Richard Levitte  (LEVITTE@eliza.e.kth.se)

	* vmstar.rnh:  added /BUFFER=512 to the qualifiers that should be
	used when you mount a tape.

	* todo.txt:  new file.

	* vmsmunch.c (VMSmunch):  commented away the `revision' item from
	the attribute list.  Otherwise, some very weird dates were placed
	in the file header, like the expiration date
	"15-MAR-14233 08:47:40.53".

Wed Jul 20 09:02:11 1994  Richard Levitte  (levitte@oden.stacken.kth.se)

	* data.c, vmstar.h, vmstarP.h:  new files.

	* vms2tar.c, tar2vms.c:  new files.  Parts of vmstar.c have been
	moved into these files.
	* vms2tar.c (vms2tar), tar2vms.c (tar2vms):  removed the
	dependency on as many global variables as possible.
	* tar2vms.c:  added dependency on vmsmunch.h.

	* vmsmunch.c:  added code for module identification.

	* vmstar.c:  removed dependency on vmsmunch.h.
	* vmstar.c (write_trailer):  made sure to put '\0' in all the
	header fields.
	* vmstar.c (main):  changed so the other modules don't need the
	global variable `foption'.

	* change_log.txt:  new file.  All logs below have been moved
	from VMSTAR.C, where they were residing before.  The entries by
	"unknown" are probably made by Alain Fauconnet, but I'm not sure
	yet.

Mon Jul 18 ??:??:?? 1994  Hunter Goatley  (goathunter@alpha.wku.edu)

	* Version 2.1 released.

	* vmsmunch.c (VMSmunch):  the size field in the elements of Atr
	were wrongly set with sizeof(xxx).  Changed these to ATR$S_xxx.

Mon Jul 18 ??:??:?? 1994  Richard Levitte  (levitte@oden.stacken.kth.se)

	* vmsmunch.c (VMSmunch):  if status was other than 1, VMSmunch
	would just return, without deassigning DevChan.  Now, deassigning
	is done in all the places where VMSmunch returns.


Fri Jul  1 00:35:?? 1994  Richard Levitte  (levitte@e.kth.se)

	* Version 2.0-4 released.

	* vmstar.c:  added the /HELP qualifier (and the Un*x `h' option),
	and slightly cleanup the code.

Thu Jun 23 ??:??:?? 1994  Richard Levitte  (levitte@e.kth.se)

	* Version 2.0-3 released.

	* vmstar.c (copyfile):  another small change, to preallocate the
	space needed to store the extracted file.  This also means that
	when the disk is too full, we will know when we try to create the
	file, rather than when we are half through writing it.

??? ??? ?? ??:??:?? 1994  Richard Levitte  (levitte@e.kth.se)

	* Version 2.0-2 released.

	* vmstar.c (copyfile):  small change, to allow VMSTAR to write
	binary files with a size that is not a multiple of RECSIZE.  The
	end of the last record is simply filled with '\0' (just in case
	there is trash in the tar file).

Thu Apr 28 22:22:?? 1994  Richard Levitte  (levitte@e.kth.se)

	* Version 2.0-1 released.

	* vmstar.c:  removed the `D' option, when I saw that I could use
	the `d' option. 

Thu Apr 28 07:07:?? 1994  Hunter Goatley  (goathunter@alpha.wku.edu)

	* vmstar_cmdline.c, vmstar_cld.cld:  new file.  Adds the VMS-style
	CLI interface, in addition to UNIX-style options. 

	* vmstar.c (tar2vms): modified /CONFIRM loop to allow "q" and
	CTRL-Z for quit. 

??? ??? ?? ??:??:?? 1994  Richard Levitte  (levitte@e.kth.se)

	* Version 1.7 released.

	* vmstar.c:  I added the switch `D', to decide how dots in
	directories should should be treated.
	* vmstar.c (usage): updated.

??? ??? ?? ??:??:?? 1994  Richard Levitte  (levitte@e.kth.se)

	* Version 1.6-4 released.

	* vmstar.c (vms2tar, addfile, out_file, get_attributes):  now,
	vmstar includes empty files in the tar file.  This means that the
	value of bytecount had to change.  It is -1 on unsupported file
	formats.

??? ??? ?? ??:??:?? 1994  Hunter Goatley  (goathunter@wkuvx1.wku.edu)

	* Version 1.6-3 released.

	* vmsmunch.c, vmsmunch.h:  new files, written by Jamie Hanrahan.
	This handles the setting of datetime of the extracted files.

??? ??? ?? ??:??:?? 1994  Richard Levitte  (levitte@e.kth.se)

	* Version 1.6-2 released.

	* vmstar.c (scan_file):  hacked to replace < and > with [ and ].
	Otherwise, mkdir screws up trying to make the directory
	DIR:<FOO.BAR] if you happen to stand in the directory DIR:<FOO>.
	* vmstar.c (scan_title):  made it possible to disable the coercion
	of `.' in directories to `_'.

	* vmstar.c:  added a few include files and some forward
	declarations to make DEC C shut up.

??? ??? ?? ??:??:?? 1994  Hunter Goatley  (goathunter@wkuvx1.wku.edu)

	* Version 1.6-1 released.

	* vmstar.c:  minor mods to work under OpenVMS AXP (Goatley)

??? ??? ?? ??:??:?? 1994  unknown  (unknown@unknown)

	* Version 1.6 released.

	* vmstar.c:  added 'z' option for automatic determination of file
	type on extraction.
	* vmstar.c (copyfile):  reworked to close files and exit on fatal
	error.  Error status not returned, they weren't checked anyway.
	* vmstar.c:  some code cleanup (much, much more to do...)

??? ??? ?? ??:??:?? 1994  unknown  (unknown@unknown)

	* Version 1.5-3 released.

	* vmstar.c:  removed duplicate error message.

??? ??? ?? ??:??:?? 1994  unknown  (unknown@unknown)

	* Version 1.5-2 released.

	* vmstar.c:  removed duplicate #include iodef.  Added write status
	checking in copyfile and cleaned up error handling (avoids
	duplicate messages).

??? ??? ?? ??:??:?? 1994  Mark Parisi  (MPARISI@RIPPLE.JPL.NASA.GOV)

	* Version 1.5-1 released.

	* vmstar.c (out_file):  fixed bug in out_file: if the length of a
	text file was an exact multiple of RECSIZE, flushout was called an
	additional time.
	* vmstar.c:  added some code for empty files handling.

??? ??? ?? ??:??:?? 1994  unknown  (unknown@unknown)

	* Version 1.5 released.

	* vmstar.c (out_file):  when archiving a non-text file with
	rfm=stream_lf, rat=cr attributes, VMSTAR truncated the file.
	Modified out_file to more cleanly handle various RMS file formats:
	only variable and stream_cr record formats need two passes to
	compute the actual file size and need to be read record by record.
	All other formats should by read buffer by buffer and written
	as-is in the tar archive, thus out_file now fopens the file in
	binary mode and freads buffers.  In the case of a stream_cr file,
	if a single record cannot fit in our buffers (probably because the
	file is non-text and has incorrect RMS attributes) out_file now
	error exits.

??? ??? ?? ??:??:?? 1994  unknown  (unknown@unknown)

	* Version 1.4 released.

	* vmstar.c (scan_title):  fixed a bug_title that caused VMSTAR to
	fail on extraction of absolute tarfiles (thanks to Tom Allebrandi
	for this one).  Also added some code to correctly handle dots in
	directory names found in tarfile (replaced by "_")

??? ??? ?? ??:??:?? 1994  unknown  (unknown@unknown)

	* Version 1.3 released.

	* vmstar.c (tar2vms):  changed to use standard IO calls (fopen,
	fread) to read input tarfile in binary mode i.e. no translation of
	RMS record attributes done by C RTL. This fixes problem reading
	tarfiles created with rfm=fix, rat=cr.
	* vmstar.c:  more room for file size in output formats.

??? ??? ?? ??:??:?? 1994  unknown  (unknown@unknown)

	* Version 1.2 released.

	* vmstar.c (out_file):  fixed bug not closing input VMS file,
	limited maximum number of files archived to FILLM quota
	* vmstar.c (vms_cleanup):  added mapping to underscores of some
	more characters found in Un*x file names illegal in VMS file
	names.

??? ??? ?? ??:??:?? 1994  unknown  (unknown@unknown)

	* Version 1.1 released.

	* vmstar.c:  reworked handling of current VMS default.
	Will now create *relative* tarfiles (i.e. files known as "./..."
	in tar archive directory) except when device name is specified or
	wilcard search gives filenames located above current default (tar
	cvf foo.tar [-...]*.* will lead to this kind of situation)
	* vmstar.c (make_new):  attempt to handle more than 8 levels of
	directories upon extract : .../d7/d8/d9 will be mapped to
	[...D7.D8$D9].  Also greatly simplified because mkdir() creates
	intermediate levels of directories if missing.

??? ??? ?? ??:??:?? 1994  unknown  (unknown@unknown)

	* Version 1.0 released.

	* vmstar.c:  new file.  Merged  VMS2TAR and TAR2VMS which were
	written by Sid Penstone.
	Code reworked, messages cleaned up.
	Added support for 'f tarfile' option, changed default to $TAPE.
	Added support for VMS style wildcard file names on extract.
	Added support for 'b' (binary file extract) option.
	Suppressed usage of intermediate scratch file for create
	operation.
	File list on create should now be space separated (removed
	difficult support of comma-separated list with context "a la
	BACKUP").
	Global code simplification attempt, may have broken some odd case
	handling.
	Added some error handling in tarfile write operations.
	Probably millions of bugs introduced... sorry.
