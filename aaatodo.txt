Here's the list of stuff that should be added to VMSTAR:

Short term (please concentrate on this first):

	* Make VMSTAR recognise text files that have variable length
	records and no record attributes.

	* Qualifiers for VMSTAR to specify the block factor size
	(currently, 20 is hardcoded.  This gives 10240 byte blocks.
	This should only be a default...)

Long term:

	* Capability to mount the device to which the tar dump will be
	written, if it isn't already mounted.

	* Capability to tell the user to mount a new tape if the tar
	dump takes more than one.

More things could be added with time.
